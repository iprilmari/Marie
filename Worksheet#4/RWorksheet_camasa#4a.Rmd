# a. Describe the data.
# The data contains two sets of observations for shoe size, height, and gender.

# b. Create a subset by males and females with their corresponding shoe size and height. What its result? Show the R scripts.

```{r}
males <- df[df$Gender == "M", c("Shoe_Size", "Height")]
females <- df[df$Gender == "F", c("Shoe_Size", "Height")]

males
females
```

# c. Find the mean of shoe size and height of the respondents. Write the R scripts and its result.
```{r}
mean_shoe_size <- mean(df$Shoe_Size)
mean_height <- mean(df$Height)

mean_shoe_size

```

# d. Is there a relationship between shoe size and height? Why?

```{r}
correlation <- cor(df$Shoe_Size, df$Height)

# 2. Construct character vector months to a factor with factor() and assign the result to factor_months_vector. Print out factor_months_vector and assert that R prints out the factor levels below the actual values.
```{r}

# 3. Then check the summary() of the months_vector and factor_months_vector. | Interpret the results of both vectors. Are they both equally useful in this case?
```{r}
summary(months_vector)
summary(factor_months_vector)
```

# 4. Create a vector and factor for the table below.
```{r}
directions_vector <- c("East", "West", "North")

factor_data <- factor(directions_vector)

new_order_data <- factor(factor_data, levels = c("East", "West", "North"))

# 5. Enter the data below in Excel with file name = import_march.csv. 
# a. Import the excel file into the Environment Pane using read.table() function. Write the code.
```{r}
data <- read.table("import_march.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
```

# b. View the dataset. Write the R scripts and its result.
```{r}

# 6. Full Search
```{r}
